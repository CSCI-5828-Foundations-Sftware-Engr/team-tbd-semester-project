# Team TBD Project Details

## A Calendar-based Productivity Application

Our team recognizes that graduate students can have a hard time managing responsibilities, deadlines, and other commitments. As a result, our team decided that we would develop a calendar web application. Our web app will allow users to create and manage an account, view all upcoming tasks and reminders, and create new calendar reminders. If time permits, we want.  We would aslo like to set up a service that will send an email to the user about an upcoming reminder.

Our web app will consist of a Python client-side app, a Flask server, and a SQLite database. It will be deployed on Heroku and can be found here: [Staging](https://team-tbd-project-staging.herokuapp.com), [Production](https://team-tbd-project-production.herokuapp.com).

We are co-ordinating the team using [Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/qDzf7Ekl/ATTI9736135482b19ca5c804278553f2fbf6DFCBF349/team-tbd).

We have roughly divided the work among the 4 members in the following way:
| Member  | Responsibilities |
