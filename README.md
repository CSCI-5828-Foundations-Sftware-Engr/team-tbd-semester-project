# Team TBD Semester Project
## A Calendar-based Productivity Application

Our team recognizes that graduate students can have a hard time managing responsibilities, deadlines, and other commitments. As a result, our team decided that we would develop a web application intended for keeping track of things and otherwise helping manage pieces of information for individuals that can be personalized in different ways.

Our web app will consist of a Python client-side app, a Flask server, and a SQLite database. It will be deployed on Heroku and can be found below:
