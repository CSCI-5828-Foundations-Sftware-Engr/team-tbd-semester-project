# Team TBD Semester Project
## A Calendar-based Productivity Application

Our team recognizes that graduate students can have a hard time managing responsibilities, deadlines, and other commitments. As a result, our team decided that we would develop a web application intended for keeping track of things and otherwise helping manage pieces of information for individuals that can be personalized in different ways.

Our web app will consist of a Python client-side app, a Flask server, and a SQLite database. It will be deployed on Heroku and can be found here: [Staging](https://team-tbd-project-staging.herokuapp.com), [Production](https://team-tbd-project-production.herokuapp.com).

Our Trello board can be found [here](https://trello.com/b/qDzf7Ekl/team-tbd).

Below is a diagram of a basic sequence where the user logs in, sees all saved reminders, ands adds a new reminders.
