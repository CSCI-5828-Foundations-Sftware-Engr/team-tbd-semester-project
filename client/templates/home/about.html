        <h3 id="what-is-our-project-all-about-what-are-we-trying-to-achieve-">What is our project all about? What are we trying to achieve?</h3>
        <p>Our team recognizes that graduate students can have a hard time managing responsibilities, deadlines, and other commitments. As a result, our team decided that we would develop a calendar web application. Our web app will allow users to create and manage an account, view all upcoming tasks and reminders, and create new calendar reminders. In addition, users will be able to track the number of hours they have spent on specific tasks. If time permits, we would also like to set up a service that will send an email to the user about upcoming reminders.</p>
        <h3 id="what-technologies-are-we-using-">What technologies are we using?</h3>
        <p>Our web app will consist of a Python client-side app, a Flask server, and a SQLite database. In addition, we are going to be implementing a form of monitoring for the entire system, although the logistics of this have not been fully discussed.</p>
        <h3 id="how-are-we-deploying-our-system-">How are we deploying our system?</h3>
        <p>It will be deployed on Heroku.</p>
        <h3 id="what-design-decisions-have-we-made-">What design decisions have we made?</h3>
        <p>Our database currently consists of a user table to store basic user info, a reminder table that stores all reminders for all users (it is indexed on userid), and two look up tables. The database diagram can be seen below. We chose to use SQLite for this database because it is lightweight. The basic features it offers are sufficient for our project and allow us to easily store and access data without much overhead.</p>
        <p>We have also created the basic lawet of our UI. </p>
        <h3 id="what-processes-are-we-using-to-coordinate-our-team-">What processes are we using to coordinate our team?</h3>
        <p>We are co-ordinating the team using Trello. This allows us to keep all of our user stories in what place, and is an accessible way to manage sprints, as well as view our burndown chart. Communication is orchestrated over a Slack channel, and we use GitHub for source control of all the code relevant to our project.</p>
